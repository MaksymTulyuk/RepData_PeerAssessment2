## Synopsis

This data analysis answers two questions: across the United States:
1. Which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

To answer on this question I analyse U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database that tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States between 1950 and November 2011

The analysis shows that ... has the most severe impact on population health and ... causes the greatest economic consequences
